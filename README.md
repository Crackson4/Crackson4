# Big Heading

Hi! I'm **Miyagi** ðŸ¥·. If you ever need some 'wax on wax off' wisdom, you know where to find me.

And yes, I am asian.

## Smaller Heading

I'm currently doing tertiary-level mathematics with a focus on calculus. It may sound complicated but it isn't. (Secret flex)

Programming is also one of my interests. I mainly code in `python` and `C++`.

### Even Smaller Heading

A lot of things are pretty retarded. Some of these include:

- Pronouns
- Being transgender
- Thinking that there are more than 2 genders
- Islam and Atheism
- Materialism
- Not knowing the times tables
- Being retarded ðŸ« 

If you're offended, feel free to contact me.
